The purpose of this lab was for the students to be able to choose what type of design they wanted to make and to execute it to their choosing. Students could either design a calculator, a vending machine, or a traffic signal controller. All of these options included different types of concepts and designs we have covered up to this point. The objective was for the students to be able to use what they had designed in the past and what they had learned in this class, to complete their project. I chose the calculator, this included creating a calculator, that includes 4 arithmetic and 4 logical operations. This also meant I needed to use a binary-to-BCD converter and a seven-segment display in order to create an interface for the calculator. The calculator will perform calculations on two 4-bit numbers.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80aab633-bcc2-47ca-939e-aee9b137df23)
